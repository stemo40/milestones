Milestones is a jQuery plugin that displays a timeline with milestones. The milestones are evenly separated along the timeline with labels underneath. Once a milestone is met, you can check it off and move to the next one. 

Click this link to take you to a demo page that displays the plugin in real time. Be sure to view the source to see how to set it up and options available.
